# stuff i added:
editor QoL.
true fals.
multy (doesn't work :p should draw sprite 3 times (r,g,b) with ~5 pixels offset.
some sprites (animated ones are likely by Nona).
A LOT OF options (they are are jank :p).
new themes (themes competitions was cool, thanks guys).
super modding way. it loads files from <world_folder>/assets/lua. You can see supported files in `modsupport.lua`.
timeskip prop should make unit skip `addUndo()`, so when you undo it undos to turn when `timeskip` was parsed.
uncolor is uhh hueshift? yea, something like this. Should change unit's color to opposite (NOT PALLETTE'S OPPOSITE!!! CUZ IT SHOULD WORK FOR SAMECOLR ETC.).
u_move,u_turn â€” u but only for dir/movement (u_move doesn't work cuz unit changes it's direction when it moves lol).
and object? wtf?
MOUS OBJECT? WHAR?
